The recent dramatic advances in natural language processing (NLP) technology,
such as neural machine translation (NMT) and large language models (LLM), are
changing the way people work and interact with technology. These new NLP technologies
have the potential to increase productivity and levels of automation in a wide
variety of fields.

The downside of the new NLP technology is its enormous energy consumption.
At a time when energy efficiency has become essential due to the climate crisis,
the advances in NLP are vastly increasing the energy usage of the IT sector.
The GreenNLP project addresses this issue by developing more environmentally
sustainable ways of building and using NLP applications.

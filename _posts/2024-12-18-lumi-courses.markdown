The GreenNLP project is organizing a workshop on AI training on the LUMI supercomputer together with the LUMI User Support Team (LUST) and EuroCC National Competence Centers (NCCs) in Finland.

The workshop is especially useful for researchers who wish to transition from small-scale AI training environments to the much more powerful LUMI environment. The participants will be provided with an introduction to the LUMI GPU partition. Personalized support will also be provided to participants to adapt and run their AI training scripts on LUMI. Registration for the workshop is now open. More information on the workshop is available here: ["Moving your AI training jobs to LUMI: A Hands-On Workshop](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/events/lumi-ai-workshop-feb2025/).
